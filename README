Work-in-progress. Fast desktop widgets.

This projects aims at creating a few desktop widgets that are easily extended (e.g. simple to create new widgets), while still being lean. Languages like Python are explicitly avoided, the project is written in Vala, which compiles down to (quite fast) C code.

So far, there is only a bit of demo code available in the form of a clock widget. You will need to steal CairoClock theme files as well to run it (not included): <http://macslow.thepimp.net/?page_id=23>.
